# webscraping
This script is written for practising webscraping on the best site holding the great world leagues football data in a cool format and for free.
The website is : [https://www.football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk)

# PURPOSE
Our main goal is to provide a quick tool or script to grab needed football data for main purposes. Ours are > 

- Learning Webscraping
- Machine Learning for predicting football outcomes
- Deep Learning for predicting football outcomes
- Data Science 
- etc.

So please contribute as you can to improve the code and help to understand this wide domain which is Data Science or Artificial Intelligence.

# Football Data Web Scraping Tools

## Overview

This project provides web scraping tools for extracting football data from various sources. The tools are implemented in Python, C, C++, and Java, making them versatile and accessible for educational purposes. Each implementation demonstrates the process of web scraping to retrieve football-related information.

## Features

- **Cross-Language Implementation**: The tools are available in multiple programming languages, including Python, C, C++, and Java. This allows users to explore different implementations and understand the principles of web scraping in various languages.

- **Educational Purpose**: The primary goal of this project is educational. Users can study the source code to learn how web scraping is performed using different programming languages and gain insights into data extraction techniques.

## Usage

- Choose the implementation in the language of your preference (Python, C, C++, or Java).

- Follow the instructions in each tool's documentation to understand how to use the web scraping capabilities for football data.

- Note: Ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the targeted websites and use the tools responsibly and ethically.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, additional features, or fixes for any of the implementations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# HOW TO ?

The final data structure will look like :

```
data_structure = {
    "england": {
        "Season 2023/2024": [
            ["england_Premier_League_2023-2024.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/E0.csv"],
            ["england_Championship_2023-2024.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/E1.csv"],
            ["england_League_1_2023-2024.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/E2.csv"],
            ["england_League_2_2023-2024.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/E3.csv"],
            ["england_Conference_2023-2024.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/EC.csv"]
        ],
        "Season 2022/2023": [
            ["england_Premier_League_2022-2023.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2223/E0.csv"],
            ["england_Championship_2022-2023.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2223/E1.csv"],
            ["england_League_1_2022-2023.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2223/E2.csv"],
            ["england_League_2_2022-2023.csv", "https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2223/E3.csv"]
            # ... additional seasons
        ]
        # ... additional seasons
    }
    # ... additional countries
}
```

This Python script does the following things:

1. It defines several functions like `get_csv_links`, `process_weblink`, `save_data_in_file`, `print_data_structure`, and `download_csv_files`.
2. The `process_weblink` function processes the base URL and recursively collects all the CSV links along with their associated country and season information.
3. The `save_data_in_file` function can be used to save the collected data structure into various formats such as JSON, CSV, or plain text.
4. The `print_data_structure` function prints the data structure without saving it.
5. In the `main` function, we set the output folder, base URL, call the `process_weblink` function to obtain the data structure, and then call the `download_csv_files` function to download the CSV files. You can uncomment the `print_data_structure` call at the end to view the data structure before downloading the files.
